# Bangaru CSDS 491 Final Project 

#### Abhimanyu Bangaru

In this project, I try to forecast network data using Probabilistic Graphical Models(or atleast using a PGM interpretation of other models). Much of this project was exploration-based, as the goal was to learn more about this less-popular field of AI. 

I have provided my jupyter notebooks as well as ``Bangaru_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_Final_Project.pdf``, which is a my final report.
